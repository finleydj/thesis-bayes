 This study examines the resilience of Bayesian meta-analysis to prior selection bias, comparing it with frequentist methods through simulated datasets. The results show that Bayesian methods are generally robust against bias, especially for larger effect sizes, suggesting their potential as a defense against statistical manipulation.
